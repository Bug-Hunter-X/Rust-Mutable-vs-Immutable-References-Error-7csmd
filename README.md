This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when dealing with mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through an immutable reference, which results in a compile-time error.  The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates the correct way to handle mutable and immutable references to avoid this error.
